	<p class = "" id = "">
		Git is a distributed version control system. It allows for a person, or a group of people to work on a project, and to keep track of the versions of the project. It is an organized system for managing code. This system allows for resolving conflicts in code, and it has a version history. This allows for easy management of a project, and a way to fall back just in case something goes horribly wrong.
